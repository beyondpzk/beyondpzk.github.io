On May 27, 2017, feeling dizzy and groggy from sitting too long in the office, I stepped out onto the balcony for a breather. There, I spotted a tiny blade of grass growing out of a crack in the concrete wall. I had read about such metaphors many times before, but this time, it hit me with a jolt of raw understanding. Perhaps it was the accumulation of all my past experiences that, in that very moment, made me truly comprehend what a “tenacious life” really means.
After nearly a decade of study and research in mathematics, I have found my professional calling in the field of AI. My career goal is to become an AI Applied Scientist, dedicated to gaining a deep understanding of AI technologies, leveraging them to solve real-world problems, and ultimately creating tangible social value.
